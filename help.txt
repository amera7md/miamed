To work on the tests, run "$ npm start" then open a browser and visit http://localhost:9002.

The tests are in files in the tests/app directory; you will need to fill out
the answers in the corresponding files in the app directory, reloading your
browser to see whether the tests are passing.

For some tests, the instructions will be more involved; in those cases, the
inline comments should give you the details you need.

You are allowed to read the files in /tests as well as using Google, Stackoverflow or whaterever
tools you are used to. Please send the files you edited in /app back to tak@miamed.de before 2 hours at the latest.
